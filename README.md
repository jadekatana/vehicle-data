# vehicle-data
This app shows vehicle data and allows users to compare selling prices of model years. Users can also see which vehicle type has the highest selling value. 
We used streamlit, plotly.express, pandas, and altair to deploy this app. Users will have to install and import these packages in order to run the app locally. 
Run on terminal using streamlit run app.py on your command line after installing required packages as well as cloning this entire repository. 
App URL is https://vehicle-data.onrender.com/

Steps for running the app locally:
1. Open a terminal/command line.
2. Use the cd command to navigate to the repository directory which is called "vehicle-data".
3. Make sure you have installed all the necessary packages which are located in the requirements.txt file.
4. In the command line of the root directory for vehicle-data, type $ streamlit run app.py
5. Now you will get a link to copy and paste into your browser that will run the app locally.
